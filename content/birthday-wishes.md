# Birthday wishes

On Saanvika’s birthday, friends and family shared messages filled with love,
blessings, and warmth.

These wishes were written in a fleeting moment —
without filters, without planning —
just honest words from the heart.

They are preserved here exactly as they were received,
as a reminder of how deeply she was loved from the very beginning.
