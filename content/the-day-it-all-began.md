# The day it all began

This website began on a special day.

What started as a simple birthday page was created to celebrate love,
family, and togetherness — without any long-term plan or intention.

At the time, it was just a moment.
A way to capture feelings that words could barely express.

## A day full of warmth

That day brought together wishes, blessings, and quiet happiness.
Friends and family shared words that came straight from the heart.

Those messages mattered.
They still do.

They were written in a moment that cannot be recreated —
and that is what makes them valuable.

## Why this page still exists

As time passed, the website itself changed.

Infrastructure changed.
Technology changed.
The original format changed.

But the words did not.

This page exists to preserve that moment —
not as an event,
but as the beginning of a longer story.

## Looking back, moving forward

What was once a single celebration has now become something else:
a living journal that will grow slowly over time.

This page marks the first chapter.
Everything else builds on it.
