# A simple first birthday at home

In many families, a child’s first birthday is celebrated in a grand way.
Big gatherings, decorations, new clothes, and a lot of excitement.

We thought about doing the same.
But as the day approached, we found ourselves asking a few quiet questions.

## Who is the celebration really for?

The first question was simple.

Would she enjoy it?

At one year old, she had no concept of birthdays,
no friends of her own,
and no understanding of crowds or noise.

A large celebration would mostly be for us —
our relatives, our friends, our extended family.

That realization made us pause.

## Comfort over appearance

We also thought about clothes.

Fancy outfits look beautiful in photographs,
but are they comfortable?
Are they breathable?
Would she want to wear them again?

Instead of one elaborate outfit,
we chose a few simple, soft dresses.

She wore one in the morning for cake cutting,
another in the evening while playing,
and a fresh one at night for dinner.

She was comfortable, happy, and completely herself.
That mattered more to us than how things looked.

## A day that felt like us

We celebrated in a way that felt calm and familiar.

The morning was spent at home.
Family and relatives joined on video calls.
There was laughter, familiar voices, and warmth,
without overwhelming her senses.

We had ordered a rasmalai cake,
and she accepted it happily, without hesitation.

In the evening, we went out for a family dinner —
just the three of us.

It wasn’t about the setting or the occasion.
It was simply time together.
She enjoyed the change of space, the lights, and being around us,
curious and content in her own way.

The day moved slowly.
No rushing.
No schedules.
Just being present with our kid.

## Looking back

This choice may not be right for everyone.
Every family celebrates differently,
and every approach comes from love.

For us, this felt right.

The simplicity allowed us to be present.
And the money we saved quietly became part of something else —
long-term plans and investments for her future.

A different kind of gift.
